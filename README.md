# Tab Explorer

In an effort to better understand the what our browsing habits look like, we crafted this lovely little Google Chrome extension to replace your history page! (To hell with linear views - bring on the lateral thinking!) Right now it uses Sigma.js but d3.js has some pretty hot rendering ...

## Usage

Download the repo to wherever, and load it into Chrome as per their charming [tutorial.](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html#load)

## Todo

* Add a bootstrap bar with some buttons for manipulating the graph.
* Label nodes with site names, and make hoverable boxes show the url.
* Perhaps eventually involve a database somewhere in here for persistant/portable storage of your history graph.
